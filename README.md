Only the Nav bar changes color when you are on a certain page. 

For example: if you are in the home page, the **Home** section changes to a different color. This allows the user to have an idea and know that they are in the home page.

## Performance Testing
For this I used the Lighthouse Web dev tool that is in Google Chrome and below are the results which I am satisfied with.

<img src="assets/images/website-performance.jpg">

## Known Bugs
To my knowledge, there are currently no bugs present in the website.

## Issues and Fixes during development
- In the Home Page, I had an issue with centering the Hero text that is inside of the hero image. To fix this, I used a display of a table to the hero image and used a display of a table cell
to the hero text. I then used, text-align center and vertical align to the middle.
- In the Sign Up page, I had an issue in bringing the form to the centre of the page. This was fixed by setting margin to auto on ".signup-box"

## Future Improvements or Enhancements
While developing this project, I thought of different methods that I could use to improve this website or include it into future projects:
- The use of a **Hamburger** menu, this could be used for smaller screen sizes such as a mobile device.
- I could also include a **Back to the Top** button for when users are at the bottom of the page.
- Using **flexbox** or the use of **grids** for the structure of the page. Although I did use flex, I believe that making use of flexbox and grids could cut development time as throughout this project, I positioned elements using floats, percentages and widths. I believe that the use of flexbox and/or grids could benefit me in the future, depending on the type of project I create.

# Deployment

Github was used to create and deploy this website. The following are the series of steps to take to deploy this website on **Github Pages**:
1. Visit [Github](https://github.com/), login to your account.
2. Once you have signed in to your account, click the icon on the top right corner of your screen and click the dropdown menu that says **"Your repositories"**. This will take you to your repository page.
3. When you arrive at your repository page, click the repository that you want to publish, so for me. [This](https://github.com/Mark-O-S/trade-boost) is the repository that I will click.
4. Once you click your repository and arrive to that page, you should see the following:
- Issues
- Pull requests
- Actions
- Projects
- Wiki
- Security
- Insights
- Settings
5. From this list, there is a settings button. Click on **"Settings"**
6. Once you are in the settings menu, click on **"Pages"**
7. Once you are in that section, below the **"Source"** heading. Ensure that the option says **"Deploy from a branch"**. Below that underneath the **"Branch"** heading, click the dropdown menu and select **"main"** and **"/root"**. Click **Save**
8. The page should then refresh and a link will be created which will lead to your live page in Github Pages. The link of my live page is **[here!](https://mark-o-s.github.io/trade-boost/index.html)**
