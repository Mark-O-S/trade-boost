# Features

### Common Features

There are **3 common structures** which is presented throughout the whole website.

**The first is the Navigation Bar** which is at the top of the page, this has the option to click and take the user to other pages of the website. 

Both the **Nav and Footer section** has the ability to change color and light up when hovered over. 

Only the Nav bar changes color when you are on a certain page. For example, if you are in the home page, the **Home** section changes to a different color. This allows the user to have an idea and know that they are in the home page.

###### Navigation Bar for Big screen sizes 950px and above

**The third is the Hero Image section**, each page has the same hero image that is displayed underneath of the navigation bar. 

There will be text written inside of each hero image, for example:
- On the Home page, there will be text saying "Welcome to Trade Boost" centered with additional text underneath.
- On the About Page, there will be text saying "About Us"
- On the Sign Up and Login pages, the hero image will be in the background.
