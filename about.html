            <h3>Founders</h3>
            <p>From what started inside of an online forum chat. Like-minded traders shared their knowledge and were
                publishing their ideas online in an online forum until a suggestion came up to create a website to teach
                people how to trade. <br>
                Carl Tahn and Amir Khan were amongst these traders. Together, after testing proof of
                concepts, trial and error. They created Trade Boost. Fast forward 5 years later, Trade Boost has helped to create
                thousands of profitable traders and gain financial freedom.
