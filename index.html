                <h2>What is Technical Analysis(TA)?</h2>
        
                <p>Technical Analysis is a method that is used to predict the probable future price movement of a stock or currency pair.
                    In any kinds of trading, a wise trader should have an entry and exit strategy. 
                    Being able to understand price charts, more specifically, candlestick charts and using technical indicators can help you make better decisions on when to place a trade, when to exit a trade and when to stay away from the market (no trade is also a trade).</p>

                    Candlestick charts are commonly used by traders to determine the possible price movements based on previous price actions and patterns.
                    It's useful because it shows four price points: open, close, high and low throughout the period of time in which the trader selects (example: 1 day, 4hour, 5 min chart. A single bar represents the time selected)</p>

                <h2>Styles of Trading</h2>
            
                <p>(Styles of Trading, Swing trade, Day trade, Futures, Options etc. Img on the left side.)
                    There are different styles of trading, for example:
                    Day trader opens and closes a trade or multiple trades within the same day.
                    Swing traders can take a trade that lasts a couple of days up or months before they take profit from an anticipated price move.
                    Scalp traders specializes in profiting off of small price changes and making a fast profit off reselling, the aim is to keep compounding the small profits until it turns into a big gain.
                    Position trading is a long-term trading style where trades are kept open for months or years. The difference between position trading and investing is that position traders have a stop-loss and take-profit target (just like any trader should have). Investors adopt a buy and hold strategy. 
                    With any style of trading comes risk management and it is very important that traders practice this. This is why Technical analysis is used, to give the trader a better insight into where the price action is going.</p>
